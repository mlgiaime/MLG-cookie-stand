And who's just fine to sit and wait? I gave it everything Cause I just wanted you. Who wants to celebrate? I don't have time to sit and wait. I gave it everything And I just wanted you to feel the same. We've all so often heard it said There's a road up ahead That's just beginning. It's hard to see from where I stand There's a future close at hand And it's worth living. I've been blessed and I've been cursed I've been the best, I've been the worst. Now I'll take what's mine. Who wants to celebrate? And who's just fine to sit and wait? I gave it everything Cause I just wanted you. Who wants to celebrate? I don't have time to sit and wait. I gave it everything And I just wanted you to feel the same. Who wants to celebrate? And who's just fine to sit and wait? I gave it everything Cause I just wanted you to feel the same.</p>

        <p id="merch">Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. What? What?! WHAT?! River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could...</p>
