Wednesday 11/4/15 -- Peer-programming
Partner: Dan Schwartz
I received a considerable amount of help/tutoring from Dan followed by myself driving for his html form while I was navigator and he was driver for mine while I was navigator.

Thursday 11/5/15 -- Client-facing salmon cookie webpage created. CSS is still in progress. JS now has a table that will populate user input into the table after clicking a button.

Friday-Sunday 11/6-8/15-- Added animation in CSS. Close to done with pages. CSS is still in progress. Style guide incomplete as well.

Monday 11/9/15-- Attempted more CSS with minimal success. The page content is no longer overlapping, but there is definitely more work to do at another time.
